## Detailed Explanation

### Environment
- **production**: Indicates if the environment is production. Defaults to `true` if the service is running from the `dist` directory.
- **SERVICE_URL**: The base URL where the service is hosted. Ensure this is set correctly in production.
- **PORT**: The port on which the service listens. Default is `4000`.
- **HOST**: The network interface to bind to. Use `"127.0.0.1"` to restrict access to local requests or `"0.0.0.0"` to accept external connections.
- **CORS_ORIGIN**: An array of allowed origins for CORS requests. This ensures that only specified domains can access the service.

### Chat Service
- **UPLOAD_DIR**: The directory where uploaded files are stored. Ensure this directory exists or is created during initialization.
- **UPLOAD_URL**: The URL path for accessing uploaded files. This should match the `UPLOAD_DIR` configuration.
- **user_filter**: Filter criteria for users, provided as a JSON object or stringified JSON. For example, `{"active": true, "role": "admin"}`.

### Database
- **DB_TYPE**: Defines the type of database used. Supported values are `"sqlite"`, `"mysql"`, and `"postgres"`.
- **DB_PATH**: Path to the SQLite database file. Used only when `DB_TYPE` is `"sqlite"`.
- **DB_URL**: The URL for connecting to non-SQLite databases. This is an alternative to specifying `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASS` individually.
- **DB_NAME**: Name of the database.
- **DB_HOST**: Host for non-SQLite databases.
- **DB_PORT**: Port for non-SQLite databases.
- **DB_USER**: Username for non-SQLite databases.
- **DB_PASS**: Password for non-SQLite databases.
- **logging**: Controls TypeORM logging. Refer to the [TypeORM Logging Documentation](https://orkhan.gitbook.io/typeorm/docs/logging) for syntax and possible values.

### User Entity
- **user_table_name**: Specifies the name of the user table in the database. Default is `"users"`.
- **user_entity**: Defines the user entity class used by the service. By default, it is set to `DefaultUser`.
- **user_mapping**: Allows customization of user field mappings. For example, you can map `full_name`, `avatar`, and `bio` to different database fields.

### Authentication
- **AUTH_MODE**: Specifies the authentication mode. Options include `direct`, `auth-endpoint`, `jwt`, `custom`, and `proxy`.
#### Auth Endpoint Mode
- **AUTH_ENDPOINT_URL**: The URL for the authentication endpoint. Used when `AUTH_MODE` is set to `auth-endpoint`.
#### JWT Mode
- **TOKEN_NAME**: The name of the token used for authentication. This is typically stored in cookies or headers.
- **TOKEN_SECRET**: The secret key used for signing and verifying JWTs. Change this value in production for security.
- **JWT_ALGORITHM**: The algorithm used for signing JWTs. Default is `"HS256"`.
- **JWT_USER_ID_FIELD**: The field in the JWT payload that contains the user ID. Default is `"id"`.
#### Proxy Mode
- **TRUSTED_PROXIES**: A list of trusted hostnames for proxy authentication. Requests from these hosts are considered secure.
- **PROXY_SECRET**: A shared secret used for proxy authentication. This ensures that only trusted proxies can forward requests.
- **PROXY_USER_ID_SOURCE**: Specifies where to find the user ID in proxy requests. Options include `"body"`, `"query"`, or `"headers"`.
- **PROXY_USER_ID_FIELD**: The field name containing the user ID in proxy requests. Default is `"user_id"`.
#### Custom Auth Mode
- **customAuthFunction**: A custom function for implementing authentication logic. It should return a user object with at least an `id` property.
